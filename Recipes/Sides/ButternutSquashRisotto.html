<font size=+2>
1 pound butternut squash<br>
7 1/2 to 8 cups vegetable stock<br>
2 teaspoon parsley<br>
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br>
salt and pepper to taste<br>
1/4 c olive oil<br>
1 yellow onion<br>
1 1/2 cups Arborio rice</font>
</ul>

<li>Scoop out the pulp from the cooled squash halves and
    place in a food processor with 1/4 cup of the stock.  Puree
    until smooth.  Transfer to a saucepan and add the parsley and
    nutmeg.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover to keep warm,
    adding a little stock if the puree begins to dry out.</li>
<li>Pour the stock into a saucepan and bring to a boil.
    Reduce the heat to low so that the stock barely simmers.
<li>In a saucepan, over medium heat, warm the olive oil.</li>
    Add the onion and saute until soft and translucent - 15
    minutes.  Add the rice, stir to coat with the oil, and cook
    stirring, until the edges are translucent, 3-4 minutes.  Add a
    ladleful of the simmering stock and continue to stir
    constantly over medium heat.  When the stock is almost fully
    absorbed, add another ladleful.  Stir steadily to keep the
    rice from sticking and continue to add more stock, a ladleful
    at a time, as soon as each ladleful is almost absorbed.  The
    risotto is done when the rice is tender but firm, about 20
    minutes total.  Stir in the squash puree and season with salt
    and pepper.</li></font></ul>
