<li>To make the shortbread crust: Sift flour into a bowl. Rub in butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine bread crumbs. Mix in brown sugar and shape dough into a ball.</li>
<li>Press dough into a greased 9-inch square pan. Prick all over with a fork.  Bake at 375 degrees until set and golden brown, about 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool.</li>
<li>To make the caramel: Combine condensed milk, butter, and brown sugar in a nonstick saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until caramel comes to a boil. Reduce heat and cook until golden and pulling away from the sides of the pan, 5 to 10 minutes. </li>
<li>Pour caramel over cooled crust and refrigerate until firm to the touch, about 1 hour.</li>
<li>To make the chocolate topping: Place chocolate in top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Spread melted chocolate over cooled caramel. Refrigerate until chocolate hardens, about 15 minutes. Cut into bars.</li>
