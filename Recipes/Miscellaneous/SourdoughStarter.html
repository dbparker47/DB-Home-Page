<li>Day 1:  In the morning, combine a little less than 1/2 cup flour and an appropriate amount of water.  In the evening, stir vigorously.</li>
<li>Days 2, 3, & 4:  Add a little less than 1/4 cup flour each morning with the appropriate amount of water.  In the evening, stir vigorously.</li>
<li>Days 5 & 6:  Add a little less than 1/2 cup flour each morning with the appropriate amount of water.  In the evening, stir vigorously.  Yeast should be very active by now.  This leaves you with a little more than 1 cup starter.
<li>To put starter to sleep, let it sit 2 hours after a feeding at room temperature, add flour to dry it out into a ball, and refrigerate.</li>
<li>To wake up starter (a few days before baking bread), bring to room temperature, feed with same amount of water and flour as above twice daily (discarding 80% each time), until starter is lively.</li></ul>
