<ul>
<font size=+2>
1 tablespoon olive oil<br>
2 cups minced onion (1 large onion)<br>
1/4-1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
1 teaspoon dried basil<br>
1 teaspoon dried oregano<br>
2 1/2 pounds fresh spinach, stemmed and finely chopped<br>
5 medium cloves of garlic, minced<br>
3 tablespoons flour<br>
1 pound feta cheese, cut into cubes<br>
12-16 ounces lowfat cottage cheese<br>
1/3-1/2 cup olive oil (for the filo dough)<br>
1 pound filo pastry leaves - defrosted (unwrap just prior to step
5)</font>
</ul>
<ul><font size=+2>
<li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a Dutch oven (large pot).  Add
    onion, salt, garlic, and herbs, and saute until the onion is
    soft.  Add spinach, turn up the heat and cook, stirring often
    until the spinach wilts.</li>
<li>Sprinkle in the flour, stir and cook over medium heat 2
    to 3 minutes more.  Remove from the heat.</li>
<li>Mix in the cheeses.  Taste to correct seasoning.</li>
<li>Oil a 9'' x 13'' baking
    dish. Place a sheet of filo dough in the oiled dish, letting
    the pastry edges climb up the sides.  Brush lightly with oil,
    and add one or two more sheets.  Keep going until you have a
    pile of about 8 oiled sheets.  Add half of the filling,
    spreading it to the edges, then repeat with about 8 more
    sheets of oiled filo, followed by the remaining filling.
    Layer the rest of the filo over the filling, brushing oil in
    between.  Oil the top, tuck in the edges, and bake at 350
    degrees uncovered
    for about 45 minutes or until golden and crispy.  Cut into
    squares and serve hot or warm.</li></font></ul>
