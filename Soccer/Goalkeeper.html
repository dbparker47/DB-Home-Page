<ul>
<li>Technique Drill: Split players into as many lines as there are coaches. Coaches kick, and players make saves.</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Low Drill (K+): Goalkeeper kneels on one knee, catching ball with fingers down, palms out.</li>
	<li>Low Dive Drill (2+): Goalkeeper dives to catch. Make sure to keep body low, land on side with body facing forward, hands facing the ball. Start by diving without the ball.</li>
	<li>Chest-High Drill: Hard throw chest-high. Catch with fingers up, palms out.</li>
	<li>Waist-High Dive Drill: Same as Low Dive Drill, but ball is thrown waist-high.</li>
	<li>Jump-High Drill: Throw or kick ball above the head, high enough to necessitate a jump. If we want to get fancy, push ball “over the goal”.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Jump-Spin-Dive: Jump with height to one side, immediately jump back to starting point spinning 180 degrees, and do low dive (with someone throwing ball).</li>
<li>Monster vs. Goalkeeper: Coach Kicker outside the penalty box kicks or dribbles ball into penalty box. Goalkeeper comes out and dives on ball. Don’t kick the keeper.</li>
<li>Do agility drills or jumping back and forth with someone throwing/kicking a ball at you.</li>
<li>Squat Kicks: Face a partner a few feet away, each with a ball in front of the same foot (right or left) touching with hand. At the same time, each goalie softly kicks the ball forward. Goalies stop the ball with top of hand. Repeat.</li>
</ul>
