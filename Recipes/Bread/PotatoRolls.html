<ul>
<font size=+2>
1 1/2 cups warm water (110-115 degrees)<br>
1 package Active dry yeast (1/4 oz)<br>
2/3 cup sugar<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
2/3 cup soft shortening<br>
2 eggs<br>
1 cup lukewarm mashed potatoes<br>
7 to 7 1/2 cups flour</font>
</ul>
<ul><font size=+2>
<li>In bowl, dissolve yeast in water.  (you can add about 1/2 teaspoon sugar to get it to grow better.) Stir in sugar, salt, shortening, eggs, and potatoes.  Mix in flour with hand until dough is easy to handle.  (you can use a dough hook on the Kitchen Aid.)</li>  
<li>Turn onto lightly floured board.  Knead until smooth and elastic.  (you can do all but the last bit of kneading with the dough hook.)  Place greased side up in a greased bowl.  Cover with damp cloth.  Place in refrigerator.</li>
<li>About 2 hours before baking, shape dough into rolls.  (you can make 3 small balls to make clover-leafed rolls.)  Cover and let rise until double, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Bake at 
400 degrees for 11 minutes (13 minutes for pyrex cake pan).  Makes 4 dozen medium rolls.</li></font></ul>
