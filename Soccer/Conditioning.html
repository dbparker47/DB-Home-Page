	<li>Straight Figure Eight: Run from one corner of field to the opposite corner of the field; then run along the goal line to the other corner; then run to the opposite corner;  and then run along the goal line back to the start.</li>
	<li>Change of Direction: </li>
	<li>Half-Field Lines: Racer runs to end of penalty box, back to baseline, then runs to midfield and back to baseline, perhaps more than once. Run slowly or walk to midfield between sets. Run lines in reverse.</li>
	<li>Full-Field Lines: Same as Half-Field lines, except continue to opposite penalty box and then to opposite baseline.</li>
	<li>Cut and Run: Run at moderate pace diagonally, periodically cutting to change direction to the other diagonal direction (i.e. 90â—¦ turn). Repeat.</li>
	<li>Mini-Lines: Place three markers in a line, each consecutive one about 15 feet apart. Start on one end. Run to middle marker, back to starting marker, across to other-end marker, back to middle marker, back to other-end marker, and back to starting marker. Repeat.</li>
	<li>Mini-Figure Eight: Same as Straight Figure Eight, except markers are in a
square whose sides are about 15 feet long.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Agility Drills</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Around the Ball: Place a soccer ball on the ground. Move around the soccer ball in a tight circle quickly always facing the same direction (i.e. you will be moving forward some of the time, sideways some of the time, and backward some of the time).</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Round and Round: Do multiple loops until done. Then change direction.</li>
		<li>Wind-Unwind: Change direction every loop with continuous movement.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>High-Step & Pose: Set up two markers about 6 feet apart. High-step for five steps in each direction between the markers. Pause on the foot you land on to change direction (like a lunge).</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Side-to-Side: Move sideways with high-stepping.</li>
		<li>Back-and-Forth: Move forward and backward.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Footwork Ladder Drills: Concentrate on being relaxed and moving feet as quickly as possible.</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Forward Run: Face forward. Run along ladder, stepping to the next space with one foot and bringing the other foot into the same space. Switch feet when you switch directions.</li>
		<li>Side Run: Face sideways. Run sideways across ladder. Back foot steps in space where front foot just was. Front foot steps in space adjacent to where it just was. Do both sides.</li>
		<li>Side-to-Side: Face forward. Step one foot into the first space between rungs. Then step in same space with other foot. Place first foot outside the ladder (to the side). Repeat with other foot in the next space between rungs. Repeat.</li>
		<li>Toe-Dipping: Face forward. Put one foot in the first space between rungs. Step outside the ladder (to the side) with other foot. Step outside with first foot right next to second foot. Step again on second foot (same spot as it was), and step into next space between rungs with the first foot. Keep going. Do both sides.</li>
