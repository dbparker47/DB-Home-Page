2 1/2 pounds (1.14 kg) medium starch yellow potatoes (such as Yukon Golds), peeled and cut into 1- to 2-inch cubes<br>
4 medium scallions (1 1/2 ounces; 43 g total), white and green parts thinly sliced and divided<br>
6 tablespoons (85 g) unsalted butter, plus more for serving<br>
3 medium cloves garlic (15 g), minced<br>
1/2 head small cabbage (1 pound; 455 g), halved lengthwise, cored, then cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices (about 3 cups)<br>
3/4 cup (180 ml) whole milk, plus more as needed<br>
2 tablespoons finely chopped laver seaweed (also sold in sheets as nori; optional, see notes)<br>
1 tablespoon (9 g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt, plus more to taste; for table salt use half as much by volume<br>

<li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, cover potatoes with water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. </li>
<li>While potatoes are cooking, in a large saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Once butter is melted, add white and light green scallion slices and garlic and cook, stirring often, until fragrant and translucent, about 1 minute. Add cabbage and cook, stirring occasionally, until cabbage is tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in milk and seaweed, if using, bring to a simmer, then remove from heat. </li>
<li>In a colander, drain potatoes, shaking off any excess water. Set a ricer or food mill over now-empty pot and pass potatoes through. Add milk and cabbage mixture, salt, pepper, and half of sliced green scallion tops; fold until just combined. If potatoes are too thick, fold in additional hot milk as needed for desired potato texture. Season with additional salt to taste, if needed. Transfer to a serving bowl and sprinkle with remaining scallion greens. Top with pats of butter and black pepper. Serve. </li></font></ul>
