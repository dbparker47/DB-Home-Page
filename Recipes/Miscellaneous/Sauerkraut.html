Do you dare?<br>
Get ceramic crock designed for sauerkraut, if you're serious (holds at least 8 cups).  Or you can use quart canning jars.<br>
4 pounds cabbage (or mostly cabbage with apples, onions, daikon radish, carrots, etc)<br>
6-8 teaspoons fine sea salt (1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons per pound of cabbage)<br>
Spices (ginger, garlic, and "hot peppers").  I think I should try 4 cloves minced garlic (more?), 4-inch piece ginger, 2 tablespoons red pepper (more?).  Leave out red pepper if kids want to taste.  Could add 4 green onions as well.<br>

<li>Thinly chop  or shred cabbage into 1/4-inch slices, and place in very large bowl.  Slice other fruits or vegetables to about same thickness.  Can grate carrots.</li>
<li>Add salt to cabbage mixture, mixing with hands.  Squeeze cabbage and pound on mixture (this sounds fun).  Squeeze, bruise, or pound cabbage to speed up water extraction process.</li>
<li>Use taste to adjust salt in mixture.  Add spices and toss.</li>
<li>Pack mixture in crock and squeeze out all air in mixture.  Make sure veggies are submerged in liquid.  Push veggies down tightly with fist to do the job.  There should be at least 3 inches between packed cabbage and top of jar.</li>
<li>Weight veggies down with small ceramic or glass jar, or insert something nonreactive between the lid and vegetables to keep them submerged (plastic bag with stones or ping-pong balls).  Add water if necessary.</li>
<li>First few days:  Store at room temperature (65-75 degrees).  Then move to basement.</li>
<li>Wait.  Remove any mold or discolored sauerkraut.Taste it every week until it's good.</li>
<li>Note:  If using canning jars, let gas out when metal top bulges.  Reseal.
