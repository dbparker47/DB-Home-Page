<ul>
<font size=+2>
6 plum (Roma) tomatoes, quartered lengthwise<br>
salt<br>
1 1/2 cups dried lentils<br>
3 tablespoons olive oil<br>
1 onion, minced<br>
1 carrot, peeled and minced<br>
1 celery stalk minced<br>
6 cups vegetable stock<br>
1 pound red new potatoes, unpeeled and quartered<br>
1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary</font>
</ul>
<ul><font size=+2>
<li>Preheat an oven to 250 degrees.  Place the tomatoes,
    cut sides up, on a rack set on a baking sheet.  Sprinkle with
    salt and place in the oven for about 2 hours.  The tomatoes
    will dehydrate and intensify in flavor but should still be a
    little soft.  Remove from the oven and set aside.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, pick over the lentils and discard any
    damaged lentils or impurities.  Place in a bowl and add water
    to cover generously.  Let soak for 1 hour.  Drain and set
    aside.</li>
<li>In a saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil.
    Add the onion, carrot, and celery and saute until golden brown
    and soft.  Add the stock, drained lentils, and potatoes and
    bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer,
    uncovered, until the lentils and potatoes are tender, 30-40
    minutes.</li>
<li>Add the reserved tomatoes and the rosemary and continue
    to simmer, stirring gently to retain the shape of the
    tomatoes, until the flavors have blended, about 15 minutes
    longer.  Season with salt and pepper.</li></font></ul>
