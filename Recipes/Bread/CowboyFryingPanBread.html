<ul>
<font size=+2>
2 cups flour<br>

1 1/4 cup sugar<br>

Butter or honey
</font>
</ul>
<ul><font size=+2>
<li>Mix flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a large bowl.</li>
<li>Gradually stir in the oil and just enough water to make a light dough.</li>
<li>Knead the dough just enough to mix ingredients.</li>
<li>Grease a 7- or 8-inch frying pan.</li>
<li>Cut off enough dough to spread it 1/2-inch thick in the bottom of the frying pan.</li>
<li>Poke a hole about 1 inch wide in the middle of the dough to let the steam escape.</li>
<li>Place pan on a stove and cook until bottom of bread is browned.</li>
<li>Set pan in a vertical position in front of the fire.  Be careful that bread doesn't slip out.  Bread needs to face the fire.  Turn pan so top browns evenly.</li>
<li>When bread is evenly browned, remove it from pan and serve warm with butter or honey.</li>
