<ul>
<font size=+2>
1 tablespoon olive oil<br>
1 large carrot, diced<br>
2 large celery stalks, diced<br>
1 small yellow onion, diced<br>
1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
1 cup dried red lentils<br>
4 cups vegetable stock<br>
1 bay leaf<br>

</ul>
<ul><font size=+2>
<li>Heat the olive oil in a medium (2- to 3-quart) saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add the carrot, celery, onion, and salt and stir to combine. Cover and let the vegetables sweat, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. </li>
<li>Add the lentils, broth, and bay leaf and bring up to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and let simmer, covered, until the lentils begin to fall apart, about 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Turn off the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Taste and season with salt as needed. Ladle into bowls and serve with toppings if desired. </li>
