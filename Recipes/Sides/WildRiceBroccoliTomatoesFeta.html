<ul>
<font size=+2>
2 cups wild rice (or brown rice)<br>
4 cups water<br>
1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
1/4 cup olive oil<br>
4 cloves of garlic, minced<br>
4 medium tomatoes, diced<br>
1-2 bunches of broccoli, cut up<br>
1 teaspoon dried oregano<br>
8 ounces feta, cut into small pieces</font>
</ul>
<ul><font size=+2>
<li>Combine the rice, water, and salt in a saucepan and
    bring it to a boil over high heat.  Lower the heat to simmer
    and cook.  For wild rice - it will be about 1 hour and for
    brown rice it will be about 45 minutes.  You may need to drain
    the wild rice.  When done, remove from the heat.</li>
<li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium
    heat.  Saute the garlic 2 minutes, stirring frequently.  Do
    not brown.  Add the tomatoes and saute 2 minutes more.  Add
    the broccoli and oregano, toss well, pour in the water, and
    cover the pan.  Raise the heat to medium-high and cook 5
    minutes, or until the broccoli is tender but not mushy.
    (remove the cover occasionally and toss the mixture.)</li>
<li>Stir in the hot rice and feta cheese.  Serve
    immediately.</li></font></ul>
