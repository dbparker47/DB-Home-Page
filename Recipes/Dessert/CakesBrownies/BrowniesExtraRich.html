<ul>
<font size=+2>
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons butter<br>
1 1/4 cup sugar<br>
2 eggs, cold<br>
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons cocoa powder<br>						
1/2 cup flour<br>
1/4 teaspoon salt<br>
2/3 cup walnut or pecan pieces (optional)</font>
</ul>
<ul><font size=+2>
<li>Line an 8x8 inch pan with parchment paper.</li>
<li>Combine the butter, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a metal bowl and set the bowl directly in gently simmering water (turn it to 6) in a wide skillet. Stir occasionally with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, until the butter is melted and the mixture is hot enough that you want to remove your finger quickly after dipping it in. (It might look gritty here but do not worry, it will smooth out later.) Remove the bowl from the skillet and let it cool briefly, until the mixture is only warm, not hot.</li>
<li>Stir in the vanilla. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, stirring vigorously after each one. When the batter looks thick, shiny, and well mixed, add the flour, stir until no streaks of flour remain, and then beat vigorously for 40 strokes. It is worth it! Fold in the nuts and scrape the batter into the pan, smoothing the top</li>
<li>Bake at 325 degrees on rack in lower third of oven until a toothpick stuck in the center comes out slightly moist with batter (20 to 25 minutes). Let cool completely in the pan on a rack.
<li>Lift up the overhanging ends of the parchment paper and transfer the brownies to a cutting board. Cut into 16 or 25 squares, then lift brownies off the parchment. (If you want really good, clean slices, freeze or refrigerate just until firm first.) Sprinkle with flaky salt just before serving. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.</li></font></ul>
